                        <strong>Local Storage:</strong> This read-only interface property provides access to the
                        Document's local storage object, the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to
                        sessionStorage, except that localStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends - that is
                        when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last “private” tab of a browser is closed
                        (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing or incognito session).

                        <strong>Session Storage:</strong> Session Storage objects can be accessed using the
                        sessionStorage read-only property. The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is
                        that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page
                        session ends.

                        <strong>Global Scope</strong>
                        The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables
                        and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of
                        that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Block Scope</strong>
                        Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of
                        the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or
                        conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from
                        within the curly brackets {}.

                        <strong>Event Loop:</strong>
                        The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the
                        Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to
                        the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.
